An **end-to-end deep learning project** to classify kidney CT scan images as **healthy** or **diseased**, using **transfer learning** with **VGG16**. The system is deployed as a **Flask-based web application** for real-time predictions and hosted on **AWS**.

---

## Features

- **Transfer Learning with VGG16** for accurate and efficient kidney image classification.  
- **Data Preprocessing & Augmentation** to improve model robustness and reduce overfitting.  
- **Interactive Web App**: Upload kidney images for real-time predictions.  
- **Experiment Tracking & Deployment**: MLflow for tracking experiments, AWS deployment for global accessibility.
